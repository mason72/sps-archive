# SPS Prism - Build Plan

## Phase 1: Project Foundation [DONE]
- [x] Initialize Next.js project (TypeScript, Tailwind, App Router)
- [x] Database schema (Supabase + pgvector)
- [x] R2 storage client
- [x] Supabase client setup

## Phase 2: Upload Pipeline [DONE]
- [x] Upload API route (presigned URLs → direct R2 upload)
- [x] Upload UI (drag-and-drop with react-dropzone)
- [x] EXIF extraction + filename parsing (SmithJohn_001.jpg → "Smith, John")
- [x] Upload completion endpoint (triggers AI processing)

## Phase 3: AI Pipeline [DONE]
- [x] Modal serverless GPU functions (CLIP + ArcFace + aesthetic scoring)
- [x] CLIP embedding generation (768-dim, semantic search)
- [x] ArcFace face detection + embedding (512-dim, face clustering)
- [x] Aesthetic scoring (sharpness, exposure, eyes-open)
- [x] Zero-shot scene classification (25 scene categories)
- [x] Smart stack grouping logic (face stacks + burst stacks)
- [x] Auto-generated sections (scene-based for events, alphabetical for headshots)

## Phase 4: Gallery + Search [DONE]
- [x] Semantic search API (text → CLIP embedding → vector search)
- [x] Filename search (real-time, 100ms debounce)
- [x] Search UI with mode switching (auto/semantic/filename/selfie)
- [x] SmartStack component (expandable, best-on-top, "set as best")
- [x] ImageGrid (masonry layout, JS round-robin for L→R reading order)
- [x] Section tabs (AI-generated, overlapping sections)
- [x] Event creation page
- [x] Global search page (cross-event archive search with real images)

## Phase 5: Design System [DONE]
- [x] Editorial design system (Playfair Display + Inter, stone palette, emerald accent)
- [x] All 11 component files rewritten with editorial styling
- [x] Pricing strategy defined (docs/PRICING.md)

## Phase 6: Data Wiring + Processing Pipeline [DONE]
- [x] GET /api/events/[eventId] — single event with images/stacks/sections
- [x] Event detail page fetches real data (replaced stubbed loadEvent)
- [x] Search results include presigned thumbnailUrls
- [x] Inngest client with typed event schemas
- [x] Inngest functions: processUploadedImage, buildEventStacks, processImportedEvent
- [x] Inngest API route (serve endpoint)
- [x] Upload/complete triggers Inngest pipeline
- [x] SPS import triggers Inngest pipeline
- [x] Thumbnail generation utility (sharp, 3 sizes)
- [x] Set as Cover endpoint (PUT /api/stacks/[stackId]/cover)
- [x] Homepage event list dashboard
- [x] 0 TypeScript errors, all routes 200

## Phase 7: Auth + Shares + Polish [DONE]
- [x] Auth flow (login/signup with Supabase)
- [x] Middleware route protection + session refresh
- [x] Share link generation + client-facing gallery
- [x] Password-protected galleries
- [x] Favorites/proofing workflow (localStorage + server)
- [x] Lightbox / image viewer with metadata panel
- [x] Image detail API with EXIF + download URLs

## Phase 8: Thumbnail Pipeline + Fixes [DONE]
- [x] Fix processing_status check constraint ("uploaded" → "complete")
- [x] Fix 446 images stuck at "pending" status
- [x] Thumbnail generation wired into upload/complete (fire-and-forget)
- [x] All API endpoints serve thumbnailUrl (thumb-md) + originalUrl (original)
- [x] Grid images use thumbnail with onError fallback to original
- [x] Lightbox uses originalUrl for full-res viewing
- [x] Search page renders actual image thumbnails (was text placeholders)
- [x] Events API scoped to authenticated user (service client RLS bypass fixed)
- [x] Homepage force-dynamic to prevent caching stale auth state
- [x] Upload concurrency increased to 12 workers
- [x] EXIF extraction made non-blocking (fire-and-forget)
- [x] Search debounce optimized (100ms filename, 400ms semantic)
- [x] Semantic search graceful fallback when Modal not configured
- [x] .env.example updated with MODAL_API_URL
- [x] Migration 003 ready (thumbnail_generated column)

## Phase 9: Production Readiness [TODO]
- [ ] Run migration 003 (thumbnail_generated boolean)
- [ ] Batch-generate thumbnails for existing 446 images
- [ ] Generate proper database.types.ts from Supabase schema
- [ ] Vercel deployment config
- [ ] Modal deployment
- [ ] Domain + CDN setup for R2

## Phase 10: SPS Integration [TODO]
- [ ] Wire up API endpoint for SPS → Archive transfer
- [ ] Wire up API endpoint for Archive → SPS enhancements push
- [ ] Shared auth (same Supabase project)

## Phase 11: Future Enhancements [TODO]
- [ ] Face clustering pipeline (DBSCAN on ArcFace embeddings)
- [ ] ClientIdentityModal for guest favorites
- [ ] Bulk download (zip generation)
- [ ] Image comparison view
- [ ] Activity log / analytics dashboard
